            <p>I am a UI/UX designer who currently works at a tech-startup to develop products. I began my design journey after graduating from college, where my passion for fine arts turned into creating impactful designs for users. </p>

            <p><span></span>Receiving a bachelor's degree in fine art and having a diverse aspect in design, <br/>I am able to bring a unique perspective to the UX design process. As a UI/UX designer working at a fast paced start-up, the responsibilities and skills I have learned included being able to gather and evaluate user requirements, collaborate with product managers and engineers, illustrate design ideas using process flows and sitemaps, design graphic user interface elements, develop UI mockups and prototypes, conduct user testing, and create branding elements. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="right2">In addition to this, I recently completed a UX course from Springboard where I was able to expand my skills in user research, wireframing, user testing, and prototyping. When designing user-friendly products, I understand the importance of not only identifying the problem, but also being able to think out of the box and find creative ways of developing a solution that results in a delightful user experience.</div>  
        <div class="right3">I now work as a lead designer on my team, connecting the bridge between the business goals and users needs, mentoring visual design interns as well as managing their workload.</div>
